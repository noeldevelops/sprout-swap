		<p>Technology: Margie has a desktop PC running Windows 2012 and uses Chrome as her browser. She does not have a smart phone, but has a landline at home and an internet connection through Century Link. She is not very tech-savvy. </p>
		<p>Needs: Margie is a very good grower and often has way more produce than she and her husband can eat. Even though she doesn't want to make a profit off her vegetables, she doesn't want good food to go to waste and needs a way to offer her produce to others in her community. </p>
