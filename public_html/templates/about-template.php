					<p><strong>Sprout-Swap</strong> is a social site that provides an outlet to trade, sell, or give away produce that users grow. This site helps people make a connection with others that grow their own produce as a hobby. The idea came from a friend who grows her own produce and often has an abundance of one veggie or another. She wanted a way to make sure her surplus produce didnâ€™t go to waste, either by giving it away to people who would eat it, or trading with other growers and promoting the hobby farming community. Sprout-Swap is a hub to help people make connections with other growers. </p>
